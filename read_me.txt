The algorithm incorporates standard form Canny Edge Detection methodology to sufficiently segment normalised pixel magnitudes that are formally classified through hysteresis thresholding. 
Regarding input specifications, ‘imNum’ and ‘ImDir’ are set to default values of 1 and ‘Images/’, respectively. 
Please change based on working directory nomenclature and required/desired image.
The implemented algorithm is multi-fold in nature and executes four major sub-functions to achieve the desired results. 
The overall functional output provides both predicted boundary visualisation and the value of precision and recall accuracy.
